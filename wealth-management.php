                <h3>Investment management</h3>

                <p class="lead">We all want to enjoy positive investment returns, but are often not

                    equipped with the tools or time to research stock market behaviour and weigh up the

                    options. Fortunately, mutual Funds from Financial Shore Bank can add balance, strength and

                    variety to your investment portfolio. The mutual funds are managed by Financial Shore Bank

                    Asset Management Limited's wholly-owned investment management

                    subsidiary and United States leading player in that sector.

                </p>

                <p class="lead">The Commercial banking business is built around transparency and accountability,

                    maintaining sound management practices of equal opportunity, fairness and discipline.

                    These values can be seen in the conduct of the divisionâ€™s relationship teams and the

                    overall quality of our service delivery.</p>
